    <h1>Construction of GOLD-R BioAge: Methodology</h1>

    <p>The GOLD-R BioAge was constructed using a multi-step, residual-informed framework grounded in the Gompertz law of mortality. The process involved the following key steps:</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Modeling Underlying Mortality Risk</h2>
    <p>First, the underlying mortality risk (<code>h</code>) was modeled according to the Gompertz law as a function of chronological age (<code>CA</code>):</p>
    <div class="equation">
        h = Rate ∙ exp(Shape ∙ CA)
    </div>

    <h2>Step 2: Predicting Mortality Risk from Omics Data</h2>
    <p>A LASSO regression model with 5-fold cross-validation was trained to predict the log-transformed mortality risk (<code>log h</code>) using omics data (e.g., proteomics, DNA methylation levels):</p>
    <div class="equation">
        log h = Coef ∙ CpGs + Intercept
        <div class="equation-number">(1)</div>
    </div>
    <p>This predicted mortality risk was then used to define a primary BioAge by inverting the Gompertz equation:</p>
    <div class="equation">
        log h = log(Rate) + Shape ∙ BioAge
        <div class="equation-number">(2)</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 3: Capturing the Residual Discrepancy</h2>
    <p>The discrepancy between the methylome-predicted and demographically expected mortality risk was captured as a residual term:</p>
    <div class="equation">
        Residual = log h − Shape ∙ CA = Coef' ∙ Biomarkers + Intercept'
        <div class="equation-number">(3)</div>
    </div>
    <p>A second LASSO model was developed to predict this residual directly from omics data.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Deriving GOLD-R BioAge with Predicted Residual</h2>
    <p>The GOLD-R BioAge was then derived by incorporating the predicted residual (<code>PR</code>) back into the Gompertz framework:</p>
    <div class="equation">
        GOLD-R BioAge = CA + (1 / Shape) ∙ (PR − log(Rate))
        <div class="equation-number">(4)</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 5: Scaling Transformation for Residual Underestimation</h2>
    <p>To correct for the underestimation of biological age residuals resulting from the reduced variance of the predicted residuals compared to the original residual risks (<code>RR</code>), a scaling transformation was applied. The predicted residuals were standardized as follows:</p>
    <div class="equation">
        PR' = PR × [SD(RR) / SD(PR)]
    </div>
    <p>This scaled value was then centered to the mean of the original residuals:</p>
    <div class="equation">
        PR' = PR' − Mean(PR') + Mean(RR)
    </div>
    <p>The final GOLD-R BioAge was subsequently calculated using the transformed residual (<code>PR′</code>):</p>
    <div class="equation">
        GOLD-R BioAge = CA + (1 / Shape) ∙ (PR' − log(Rate))
        <div class="equation-number">(5)</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Special Handling for NHANES and HRS Cohorts</h2>
    <p>For the NHANES and HRS cohorts, where raw DNA methylation data was unavailable, the residual was derived indirectly from established epigenetic clocks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A composite DNAmAge was calculated from the first five principal components of seven epigenetic clocks regressed on chronological age.</li>
        <li>The residual was computed using formula (3), where <code>log h = log(Rate) + Shape ∙ DNAmAge</code>.</li>
        <li>This residual was then predicted using a panel of clinical biomarkers via a LASSO model.</li>
        <li>The final biological age, termed <code>GOLD-R DNAmCli Age</code>, was derived using the above formulas (4) and (5).</li>
    </ul>
